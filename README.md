# Track-Location
Tracking Location Project
This project is a location tracking application built using Python, leveraging the power of geocoding libraries including Geocoder, Carrier, and OpenCageGeocode. It provides a convenient way to track and manage locations, offering features such as geocoding, reverse geocoding, and carrier detection.

Features:
Geocoding: Utilize the Geocoder library to convert addresses into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), enabling precise location identification.
Reverse Geocoding: Employ the Geocoder library to reverse geocode coordinates, translating geographic coordinates into human-readable addresses.
Carrier Detection: Utilize the Carrier library to identify the mobile network carrier associated with a given phone number, enhancing the application's functionality for tracking mobile devices.
